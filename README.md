# BirdNet
Customized BirdNET
This uses the [Cornell BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/) sound identification machine learning model to detect birds in your backyard from a microphone. It also uses the [Cornell eBird API](https://ebird.org/home) for getting rarity of birds in your area.

Shows which birds have been around recently, and at what times they are making noise. You can also see a spectrogram showing the frequency vs time plot of the bird call itself below and an analysis of it below that for the last 30 second recording. You can also download the full database if you want to process these results in other ways or to prepare your own plots. Settings for the site can be adjusted in the settings page if you want to change windowing or thresholds for detection.

See which birds from your area have been recorded in your yard. Generates cards for all birds detected in your region in the last 30 days (or if you have counts) based on the eBirds API. Shows your sighting counts and the highest confidence recording for each bird. You can sort by popularity, rarity, common name, or scientific name. Or you can search for a particular bird if you want to know if you have seen them recently.

See when certain birds are out with graphs showing sightings per hour of the day and per week of the year. This could help you figure out when to go outside and look for a particular bird. For example, the owl comes out in my yard at midnight every night for a couple hours. Or the bald eagle comes in at 1pm every day.
